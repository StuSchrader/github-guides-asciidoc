= GitHub Guides in AsciiDoc
Dan Allen

This repository is a fork of the https://guides.github.com[GitHub Guides] transformed into AsciiDoc and given the Asciidoctor beautification treatment.

Look for the following changes and enhancements from the original Markdown source (despite it not being available):

* Sentence-per-line formatting
* Semantic UI references (e.g., buttons)
* Itemized description lists with configurable “subject stop” characters
* Sidebars
* Font-based icons
