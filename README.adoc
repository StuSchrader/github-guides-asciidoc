= GitHub Guides in AsciiDoc
Dan Allen

This repository is a fork of the https://guides.github.com[GitHub Guides] transformed into AsciiDoc and given the Asciidoctor beautification treatment.
You can access pre-built e-book files (EPUB3 & KF8/MOBI) from the https://github.com/opendevise/github-guides-asciidoc/releases[releases] tab.

Look for the following changes and enhancements from the original Markdown source (despite it not being available):

* Sentence-per-line formatting
* Semantic UI references (e.g., buttons)
* Itemized description lists with configurable “subject stop” characters
* Sidebars
* Font-based icons
